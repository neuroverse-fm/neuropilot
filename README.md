**Disclaimer: For simplicity, all mentions of Neuro also apply to Evil unless otherwise stated.**

This extension enables Neuro-sama to write code in Visual Studio Code, either together with a programmer or on her own.
If you don't have a Neuro-sama, you can use one of the tools listed [here](https://github.com/VedalAI/neuro-game-sdk/?tab=readme-ov-file#tools) and [here](https://github.com/VedalAI/neuro-game-sdk/?tab=readme-ov-file#tools-1) instead.

> [!CAUTION]
> Depending on the permissions you activate and which of the aforementioned testing tools / AIs you use, this extension can be quite destructive to your system. I do not take responsibility for any damages caused by this extension, neither do any contributors of this project. Use Copilot mode for dangerous permissions or use the extension on a virtual machine.

Capabilities of this extension include:

- letting Neuro make inline code suggestions.
- adding Neuro as a chat participant for Copilot Chat.
- letting Neuro edit the current file.
- letting Neuro read and open files in the workspace.
- letting Neuro create, rename and delete files in the workspace.
- letting Neuro run pre-defined tasks.
- letting Neuro interact with the git repository, if one is present in the open workspace.
- giving Neuro direct terminal access.
    <!-- - letting Neuro read what you type in real time. -->
    <!--
    Not sure about including this one - this was something she could *not* do in the past, but was later implemented and moved to the list of things she *could* do.
    (Also, this comment block is indented because it would cause formatting issues otherwise.)
    -->
- letting Neuro view linting diagnostics, and be updated on linting diagnostics as they come in.

These can all be turned on or off using the extension's permission settings.
All permissions are set to "Off" by default, [except one](vscode://settings/neuropilot.permission.requestCookies).

For more detailed documentation, visit [the docs site](https://vsc-neuropilot.github.io/neuropilot).
We've recently migrated a lot of information there, so you're more likely to find the information you're looking for there.

## How to use

On startup, the extension will immediately try to establish a connection to the Neuro API.
If the extension was started before the API was ready, or you lose connection to the API, you can use the command "NeuroPilot: Reconnect" from the Command Palette.

### Autopilot/Copilot Mode

![Autopilot demo GIF](https://vsc-neuropilot.github.io/docs/demo-autopilot.gif)
![Copilot demo GIF](https://vsc-neuropilot.github.io/docs/demo-copilot.gif)

We refer to permission modes in NeuroPilot as either Autopilot mode (top GIF) or Copilot mode (bottom GIF) which can be configured alongside disabling it completely.
These refer to different levels of permission Neuro can be given over certain groups of actions.

This is in addition to the chat and completions feature that forms part of the Copilot mode on this extension.

## Security

The extension has multiple security measures in place to prevent Neuro from doing any real damage.
Neuro can only run tasks that have the string `[Neuro]` at the start of their `detail` property to control what tasks Neuro can run.

Neuro cannot open, edit, or otherwise access files or folders that start with a dot (`.`), or files in such folders.
This is mainly to prevent her from opening `.vscode/tasks.json` to essentially run arbitrary commands in the terminal, or editing `.vscode/settings.json` to escalate her permissions.
**Warning: If your workspace is inside such a folder, Neuro will not be able to edit *any* files!**

Neuro also can't change the global git configuration, only the one local to the current repository.

Note that if Neuro has direct terminal access, you should assume all security features are pretty much out the window, since she can just rewrite the settings file and run whatever commands she wants.

The same advice applies for ticking the [*Neuropilot: Allow Unsafe Paths*](vscode://settings/neuropilot.allowUnsafePaths) setting if you gave Autopilot-level permissions to Neuro for editing files.

You can find more security advice on the docs site, linked above. It also mentions how to customize the security settings.

### Neuro's cursor

Assuming the [Edit Active Document](vscode://settings/neuropilot.permission.editActiveDocument) permission isn't set to `Off`, Neuro gains her own cursor, indicated by the pink cursor in text documents. This cursor will only appear in files she has access to (which is affected by the `Allow Unsafe Paths` and `Include`/`Exclude` Patterns settings.) and you can also move the cursor yourself using the aforementioned `Move Neuro's Cursor Here` command. This allows her to work on the same file as the programmer but without having to rely on the normal cursor, which solves some problems relating to their respective actions.

Neuro's cursor will be indicated with a cursor decoration inside the text editor itself, but you can also identify the line it's on by looking to the side and looking for this icon:

![NeuroPilot v1 icon (pink)](assets/heart.png)

If you enable the [Cursor Follows Neuro](vscode://settings/neuropilot.cursorFollowsNeuro) setting, the normal cursor will automatically be moved to Neuro's cursor if she moves it. This replicates the behaviour exhibited in earlier versions of the extension.

### "Why is there a file named rce.ts in it??? Is there an intentional RCE inside this extension???" <!-- had to add this just in case -->

Copilot mode is developed for making Neuro request to do actions instead of directly allowing her to do that action.
This was called the **R**equested **C**ommand **E**xecution (or Request for Command Execution) framework when it was first conceived.
The short answer is no, there isn't an intentional Remote Code Execution vulnerability in this extension, but by enabling Neuro's access to Pseudoterminals, one could say she already has access to a very powerful RCE, so be careful with that one.

## Debugging

- Clone the repository
- Run `npm install` in terminal to install dependencies
- Run the `Run Extension` target in the Debug View. This will:
  - Start a task `npm: watch` to compile the code
  - Run the extension in a new VS Code window
