This page contains a reference list of user commands registered in the extension.

## Reconnect

Attempts to re-establish a connection to the Neuro API server.

## Move Neuro's Cursor Here

Moves Neuro's virtual cursor to where the real cursor is.
Only has a visual effect when Neuro has the Edit Active Documents permission set to Copilot or Autopilot.

## Send Current File As Context

Sends the currently open file as context, including Neuro's current cursor position.

## Give Cookie

Gives a cookie to Neuro.
You can also specify the type of cookie (default is Chocolate Chip - Neuro's favourite).

## Reload Permissions

Re-registers actions to Neuro, ensuring that actions that have been switched entirely off or on are properly registered/unregistered.

## Disable All Permissions

Fully disables all of Neuro's permissions, kills all currently open shells from tasks and terminals, and cancels Neuro's RCE request (if one was present).
Then, immediately runs [Reload Permissions](#reload-permissions) to ensure no actions are registered.

<Aside type="tip">

This command is intended to be like a red panic button, so bind it to a keyboard shortcut so you can activate it in a pinch.

## Accept/Deny/Reveal Neuro's Request

Accepts/denies/reveals Neuro's current RCE request, if one is awaiting approval.

## Ask Neuro to fix/explain

Sends the current code to Neuro in the Copilot Chat window using the `/fix` and `/explain` commands, prompting Neuro to respond appropriately.

Learn more about these commands at [Features/Linting analysis - Ask Neuro to fix/explain](/neuropilot/reference/features/linting-analysis#ask-neuro-to-fixexplain)

## Switch current Neuro API user name

Acts as a shortcut to the [Currently As Neuro API](/neuropilot/reference/settings#currently-as-neuro-api) setting, allowing you to change it to whatever value you desire.

## Open (a specific page in) the docs site

Opens the documentation site. If selecting the specific page option, also allows you to input the specific subpage to view.
