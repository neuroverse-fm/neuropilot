## Tasks

Tasks that Neuro can run are registered as individual actions.
The task properties make up its action in the following structure:

```ts
{
    name: task.id,
    description: task.description ?? task.id,
    schema: undefined
}
```

Changing Neuro-safe tasks in any way requires a [task reload](/neuropilot/reference/commands#reload-tasks).
The `[Neuro]` tag will be substring'ed out before forming the task description.

Neuro can only run one task at a time. Attempting to run another will return an error.

### Terminate Task

Terminates the currently running task.
This will also free up the task slot as soon as it has been terminated.

## Terminals

In order to run terminals, you need to define terminals in your `.vscode/settings.json`.
For info about the setting, see [its entry in the settings page](/neuropilot/reference/settings#terminals).

### Execute In Terminal

Spawns the requested shell with the preset arguments, and executes the provided command.
This can also be used to input into terminal prompts (e.g. inputting your name when the program asks to).

To prevent overwhelming Neuro, the stdout and stderrs are sent at a configurable delay to wait for all output before sending it to Neuro.

Terminals spawned by Neuro are prefixed with `Neuro:` and have the following icon:

<Console class="neuropilot-icon" />

<Aside type="tip">

If a terminal gives more output *after* Neuro executes her command, Neuro will be informed of such output.

</Aside>

### Kill Terminal Process

This will kill the shell that Neuro has selected, unless it is already killed.

### Get Current Shells

This will get the list of currently running shells and return it to Neuro.
