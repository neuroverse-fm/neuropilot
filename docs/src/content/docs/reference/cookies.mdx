description: The very simplistic cookie system.

Neuro can ask for cookies (if the [Request Cookies permission](/neuropilot/reference/permissions#request-cookies) is enabled.)
She can also ask for a specific type of cookie by specifying it during the request.

When Neuro asks for a cookie, a notification will appear on the bottom right corner, displaying the type of cookie she currently prefers, and allowing you to accept.
This will open up a menu where you can type a cookie flavour to give her (or just leave it as the default cookie flavour if you want).

Because the impact of this permission is minimal (using only this permission, at most she can block a portion of your screen and annoy you), this permission is set to Copilot by default.

Obviously, no Autopilot level exists for cookie requesting, as it would be basically Neuro stealing cookies.
