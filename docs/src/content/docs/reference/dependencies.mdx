title: Extension dependencies
description: To power some of its functionality, NeuroPilot requires some extensions to be loaded to function. This is called a dependency.
---

import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'

Multiple features require another extension to work, so this page lists them so that you are sure you have the necessary extensions to function.

<Aside type="tip">

You probably will most likely only needing to be looking for extension dependencies, as the dependencies from `npm` that we use should already be bundled in the extension pack.

</Aside>

<Aside>

As this extension was literally **made** for Neuro to control, this also assumes you have a Neuro API server ready to go as a direct "dependency".
This also means we are using AriesAlex's [TypeScript Neuro Game SDK](https://github.com/AriesAlex/typescript-neuro-game-sdk). Thanks AriesAlex!

Don't have a Neuro-sama?
Use one of the tools listed on the official Neuro Game API repository's README ([here](https://github.com/VedalAI/neuro-game-sdk/?tab=readme-ov-file#tools) and [here](https://github.com/VedalAI/neuro-game-sdk/?tab=readme-ov-file#tools-1) specifically) instead.

## Direct dependencies

### Visual Studio Code

Don't think this one needs to be explained, but there is one thing: While no guarantees it will work 100% as intended, you can try using a VS Code fork if you want (such as Cursor or VSCodium).

### Copilot Chat

ID: `github.copilot-chat`

*Required: false*

Copilot Chat allows the user to chat with Neuro on the sidebar panel.
It also powers inline completions, allowing Neuro to "complete the code".

<Aside>

You do not require a GitHub Copilot subscription to use the chat panel with NeuroPilot.

</Aside>

### Git

ID: `vscode.git`

*Required: true*

*Built-in extension*

The built-in Git extension powers Neuro's ability to interact with the git repository.

<Aside type="tip">

Despite also having Git in its name, the built-in Git Base extension is not needed to run NeuroPilot.
You may disable that extension if you wish.

</Aside>

## Indirect dependencies

### Language servers

*Powers: Linting Analysis*

Language server extensions contribute to the Linting Analysis portion indirectly by contributing to VSCode's linting diagnostics feature, which gets listened to and pulled by the extension.

### Shells

*Powers: Terminal*

To use the terminal feature, you are required to have installed shells on your computer.
